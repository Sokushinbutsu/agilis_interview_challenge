# Interview Challenge: Task Manager

Welcome! This is a simple task management application built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. Your goal is to identify and fix several bugs in the application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the backend server (port 3001) and the frontend (port 5173).

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Application Overview

This is a task management app where users can:
- View all tasks
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)
- Delete tasks

## Known Issues

There are several bugs in this application that need to be fixed. Work through them in order:

1. **The application crashes on startup** - Figure out why and fix it
2. **TypeScript compilation errors** - There are type-related issues to resolve
3. **Adding tasks doesn't work properly** - Tasks appear to be added but something is wrong
4. **Task completion has issues** - Try rapidly clicking checkboxes and run the tests

## Tips

- Use the browser's developer tools (Console and Network tabs)
- Pay attention to error messages
- Some bugs might have multiple valid solutions
- The tests can provide hints about expected behavior

Good luck!
